# Wrangle and Analyze Data
## by Aliscia Boyd


## Dataset: Tweets from the WeRateDogs Twitter account

> For this project, I wrangled and analyzed data from the WeRateDogs (@rate_dogs) twitter account. I gather the data from three different sources, assess it and clean it before analyzing.


## Summary of Findings

After cleaning the data, I explored and analyzed it to see what interesting observations I could make about the twitter account and its users.


## Key Insights

> "Charlie" and "Lucy" are the most popular names given to the dogs posted on the account.

> Most ratings given by the account users are always over 10 (the constant denominator). This lends itself to the silly and lighthearted presentation of the account.

> The one relationship between variables that stands out is the positive correlation between retweets and likes. It can be reasoned that a liked tweet is also more likely to be retweeted, so the positive correlation here makes sense.
